This program is considered a practice example of Object Orineted Programming for Python.
The idea is that this is to be used as a reference for creating a constructor class. There will be further 
examples on other OOP.py files that will be created to create robustt refernce with more ways to create 
a robust program.

There are some notes to consider:

help(): This call function and method calls the blueprint of the class.
This help() function can call anytthing on the parameter.
